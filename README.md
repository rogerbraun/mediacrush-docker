# Dockerized Mediacrush

A dockerized version of Mediacrush that should make it somewhat easy to setup.

# Installation

Clone the Mediacrush repo into `MediaCrush`. Configure your config.ini, at least the storage. 
Configure docker-compose.yml to change the storage settings if you want.

Run `docker-compose build`.
Run `docker-compose up`

Congratulations, Mediacrush now runs on your specified port.
